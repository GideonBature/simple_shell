# Simple-Shell Test Cases

## How To Use??

Super simple, you need to download the `checker.bash` script and the test case script. Both can be downloaded by selecting the task and the checker test case. Then execute the following command:

```bash
./checker.bash ./hsh <test_case_script>
```

Replace `<test_case_script>` with the name of the test case script you want to use.

**Note:**

- Only use to solve failed tasks after using the checker. Otherwise, you will waste your time.
